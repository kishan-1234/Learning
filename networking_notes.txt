Two types of topologies physical and logical
PHYSICAL                          Logical
 Star,BUs                                          OSI
                                          TCP/IP
Session layer synchronises data
N/w and data link layer is called intellligent layer
Frames in data link layer
CSMA/CD to avoid collision

Difference in Line and Link
Line - Physical
Link - Logical

Types of Modem:
X2(Either voice or data,upload speed less than downloading)
V90 downloading uploading same
Dailup in rain thundertorm  speed goes down
ISDN Integrated Service Digital Network 64 kbps 
DSL Minimum speed 256 Kbps
ADSL Minimum speed 512 Kbps (Always ON)
ADSL & DSL both are compatible with OFC
Datacard 

NIC network interface card, inbuild MAC address is there 
MAC address is unique and is tored in NIC ROM
IEEE 802.3 LAN 802.11 Wireless, 802 is 1980 february
Communication Simpltex(One-Way Communication), Half-Duplex, Duplex (Both side communication at same time)
Repeater two types:
Digital Repeater conversion as well as noise cancellation
Analog Repeater only amplifies
Three types of HUB based on data transmision rate:
Normal !0 Mbps
Fast 100 Mbps
Gigabyte 1500 Mbps
Bridge works at 2nd layer of OSI, has Forwarding table limited number of ports (one in one out)
Switch ports 4,8,16,24,48 (Standard switch is 24 port switch)
Multicast is VLAN, Switch creates table called MAC table
Switch has 3 types Normal, Fast, Giga
Router works on layer 3, used to communicate between two different LAN
Difference in wired NIC card and wireless NIC card
Wired card are always connected in PCI 
Wireless card are connected in ARM 
Access point is just like wireless router, Extension point is like repeater
Types of Wireless connection based on typw of connection:
ADhoc maximum 9-10 devices can be connectedlast
Infrastructure
TCP/IP model 5layers
app,transport,network,data,Physical
FTP,TfTP,HTTP,URL,DNS,DHCP,SMTP,SNMP
FTP used to exchange file over internet
SMTP used to exchange a file from client to server or one server to another server
SNMP manages remote network
ICMP protocol
ping internet control manage protocol
A- 0 to 127 Large Area n/w
B- 128 to 191 Medium
c- 192  to 223 Small
D- 224 to 239  Multicasting  (used for telecommunication purpose)
E- 240 to 255 Scientific R&D
Network bit - with the help of this part we can easily identify which class IP address we are using. Network bit should never be zero
Host bit- with the help of this part we can easily identify how many host we can assign in a dedicated class. Host bit can be zero
Public IP address: 
Private Ip address: 
A - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
B - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
C - 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.255.255
Automatic Private IP Address 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 (indicates that DHCP is down)
Subnet mask- all network bit are turned on and all host bits are turned off.
Calculating host bits is called subneting
classful interdomain routing is standard ractice and classless is as per need 
only till /30 we use

IPv6 and its difference with IPv4:
No concept of broadcast in IPv6, ::1 is loopback ip in ipv6 and 127.0.0.1 in ipv4, apipa fe80
if something not mention then front bits as zero is considered.
Double collon is not allowed
Public IPv6 address
3 bits for checking public or private+ 45 bits for dns + 16 bits for subnet + 64 bit interface
001 in starting is always public ip address
8 bits is ISP + 40 bits
ISA tap router has IPv4 to IPv6 support and vice versa
TCP & UDP can use any port depending upon the aplication
Latest series of router 72xx
Initially router is disabled then we type enable to go in enable mode
Then we go in config mode by typing config t
no shutdown means port will be down
Console Port is for configuration Can be used to connect router directly with PC via console cable (PC side is connected to RS 232 port and then CLI access can be gained through PuTty) for connecting router with laptop we need to connect router with console cable and then use serial to usb converter and then connect to laptop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwikAGC75LQ&list=PLz8UpOu_f4zoIai54JZFfIJxaSrmqz3B9&index=15 for better understanding
Auxilliary Port ISP incoming cable is inserted
To connnect router to router we use serial port
DCE service provider side DTE consumer side , DCE side is given clock 
exit is used to come out from interface
Static Routing & Dynamic Routing
clock rate command 64000 should be used (tries 64000 times to reach destination otherwise declare timeout or destination host unreachable)
Router to PC supports cross over cable also
Dunamic Routing Protocols:
RIP has two parts Uses Distance Vector and maximum 15 supported
V1
V2
EIGRP 
OSPF
OSPF & EIGRP link states
Router has 3 types of table:
Routing
Neighbour
Topology 
A.D. Administrative Distance if two routing protocols are configured on a router the one with lower A.D. value will be implemented
Conected interfac AD = 0
Static AD = 1
BGP = 20
OSPF= 110
RIP = 120
EIGR = 90
ACL: To maintain internal traffic (Access Control List) Two types
Named ACL- Standard ACL - 1-99
Numbered ACL - Extended ACL - 100-199
Check allow or deny
to save routerconfiguration: in priviledge mode enter do wr to save the config
copy running-config start-config
NAT- Network Address Translation. Types of NAT:
Static- One to One tranlsation of IP addresses. Static NAT allows an internal post such as a web server to have an unregistered private IP address and still be rechable over the internet
Dynamic- With dynamic NAT route maintains a list of registered internet IP addresses, everytime an internal client tries to access the internet the ruter maps it to one of the registered ip addresses that is not currently in use as a result you need to register the IP address only for the number of concurrent internet users.
PAT Port address Translation
bin file is in binary format related to iso image
Two types of WAN technology 
Leased Line connection - Protcols available are - HDLC & PPP. Two types of PPP, CHAP & MLPPP Leased line is a bidirectional in that we are getting dedicated bandwidth
Packet Switching - Frame relay and ATM comes under this technology. Packet witching is a method of grouping data transmission over a digital network which are comprised of header and payload. Packet switching is equals to share and guaranteed bandwidth b/w location
Leased line is equal to same dedicated bandwidth b/w two location
High Level Data Link Protocol (HDLC)
HDLC allows to PCs in same network to communicate with each other
PPP is encrypted vrsion of HDLC
CHAP - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
MLPP - Multi Link Line to Line Protocol
