Git notes:

To fetch remote branches: git fetch
To see all remote branches: git branch -r

To make a commit as different git user
1. First add ssh key to the new different git account
2.  Clone the project
3.  Now change the project local config to a different user
ensure that the commits appear as performed by USERNAME, one can setup the user.name and user.email for this project, too:
git config user.name USERNAME
git config user.email USERNAME@example.com


Rebase:

Say there is a master branch you create dev out of it and make 2 commits and pushed it to dev..now master has 1 more commit.

Now:

Git checkout dev
Git rebase master -> deletes 2 commits, adds master’s commit and then your 2 commits on top of it
Git status -> will show diverged branch with origin dev
Git push -> will fail
Git push -f -> ****remember use this only when the previous 2 commits pushed to dev is not being used by someone else

Otherwise if used just do a normal merge
Git checkout dev
Git pull origin master

To squash git commits
Say a dev branch is created out of master and 2 commits are added to it but you want to push all those changes as a single commit:
git rebase -i HEAD~2
