A port may labellled with multiple colours of vlan
Loopback interface is used to assign ip address to router. They are virtual interfaces. We can have many loopback interfaces. They are never down as physical interfaces can be down

A computer will ahve as many number of NIC as the number of MAC address
Problem of HUB Broadcast and shared bandwidth
Switch i same as Bridge just that switch is hardware based and bridge is software based and brdge has less nuumber of ports
Since ethernet cable as connectivity only till 100m...repatr is used in b/w just to amplify signal
Modem A/D & D/A
In routers we have IOS operating system..internetwork operating system
TFTP used for taking router configuration backup
NTP network time protocol Synchronise log between all routers
UTP - Unshielded twisted pair cable cat 1-5-5e-6
OSI open system interconnection
Presentation layer deals about what is the format of files mkv,jpeg,gif etc it also does encryption and decryption and also compression as well as decompression
Session layer handles session
To get ip address just type ping website
FF::FF .... means broadcast
TCP/IP stack and osi layer 
in TCP/IP l4-l7 are merged as application layer
and l-l2 are merged as network access layer
names of packets at different layers:
Transport - Segment
Network - Packet
Data Link - Frames
Physical - bits
Ports: (1-65535)
Well Known - 1 to 23
Registered Ports - 1024 - 49151
Port is bought from IANA Internet Assigned Number Authority
Dynamic Ports - Generated by PC (49152-65535)
Netstat can be used to check open ports
127.0.0.1 is loopback interface it can be pinged to check if NIC is working correctly
TCP:
FTP
Telnet
SSH
HTTP
HTTPS
SMTP
POP  port 110 
UDP:
TFTP trivial file transfer protocol 69
DHCP 67/68
SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol 189
DNS 53 (works on TCP as well as UDP)
PING full form Packet Internet Goffer
ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol
Anycast one to closest
Hub is a layer 1 Device
If we need subnetting of equal size its called FLSM Fixed Length Subnet Mask
Mac Address is also called Burnin Address
OUI Organisational Unique Identifier is first 3 blocks in MAC address
NIC is last 3 block Network Interface Controller
If Switch has 24 Ports then it wil have 24 MAC addresses
HUB is hal duplex device i.e. only sending or receiving can be done at a particula time 
HUB has collosion domain 1
Switch has collision domain as is the number of ports in it
HUB has broadcast domain 1
Switch has broadcast domain 1 
Actual Data in network is called as Payload
Routed Protocols: Carries actual data in network(payload) and assigns logical addresses to devices. Eg IP,IPX
Routing Protocols: Searches shortest paths and dynamically builds routing taables. Eg RIP,EIGRP,OSPF
Router's Operating System directory is in Flash(like C for windows)
When first time going to router CLI:
enter no (otherwise some pre configuration will be done by router)
then router will be in usermode
? can be enter to get command that run in that mode
To go in priviledge mode enter enable
to go back in usermode enter disable/exit
enter configure terminal to enter global configuration mode
show ip interface brief to get ip in priviledge mode
same devices are connected through cross over cable
If devices are connected popery ping wil be successful
If not proper then
Request time out if devices are not connected
Host unreachable if router does not know where to forward packet
ping and tracert work on icmp
Bootstrap is a program that runs diagnostic software tests like how much is RAM, wha are total interfaces,size of NVRAM etc
Types of memory in Cisco router and switches:
ROM-Stores Bootstrap,IOS,POST programs
Flash-Contains IOS image
RAM- Stores routing table,present config etc.
NVRAM- If configs are saved they goto NVRAM,it also holds routers, start up config
For router boot sequence check screenshots in this folder
POST- Power On Self Test it checks hardware, it also runs BIOs in case of laptop
By default all router ports are OFF	 and all switch port are ON
show cdp neighbours can be used in CISCO switches(l3)
show running config command can also be used to check configuration in router
DHCP discover is used to send message to DHCP server at port 67, then DHCP server gives IP offer at port 68 then client sends acknowledgment
Prior to DHCP, Bootstrap protocol was used it assigned autommatic IP but manual MAC address entries had to be made
Static routing is fastest and most secure 
RIP Routing Infomation Protocol
Version 1 does not suport subnetting
Version 2 supports ubnetting
Examples of Protocos
Distance Vector- RIP (Bellman Ford)
Link State- OSPF (Djiktra)
Hybrid- EIGRP (Mix of both)
IGP- Interior Gateway Protocol (OSPF,EIGRP,RIP)
EGP - Exterior Gateway Protocol (BGP)
MPLS - Multi Protocol Label Switching
add no in front of command to negate the command
loopback interface is always ON and can be 0-2147483647
In realtime type show controllers Se0/0, the side which has description of DCE there we have to give clock (clock rate 64000)
for loopback type interface loopback <no.>
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
RIP,OSPF dont support for IPv4 whereas EIGRP supports IPv6
EIGRP 5 packets:
Hello(5 seconds keep alive)
Update
Query
Reply
Acknowledgment
RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol) - End to End delivery of data
Types of ARP (Address Resolution Proocol)
ARP
Proxy ARP 
Gratitous ARP (used to detect Duplicate IP)
Reverse ARP (RARP) MAC address to IP address used in thin client computers (they have MAc but search their ip from network)
Inverse ARP
arp -a to show list of learnt MAC addresses
arp -d to delete list of learnt MAC addresses
NAT are three types
Static ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.2 1.1.1.10(in priviledgre mode) ip nate inside(on inside interface) ip nat outside (on outside interface) Not used that much as each ip has to be mapped to a public ip. Mosstly used in ervers
Dynamic
PAT
Multi Protocol Label Switching(MPLS)
MPLS is very fast than normal routing because it provides label it works on layer 2.5
Spanning Tree Protocol is used to detect loop in network by logically switching of one of the port For STP we dont need any configuration	
STP Election
Root Bridge controls other switches
Root Port - the best way to go to root bridge
Root bridge orts are never blocked
Ports are also of two types:
Forwarding Ports & Block Ports
Forwarding Ports are of two types:
Designaed Port 
Root Port
Blocking Port 
Root bridge ports are always Designated Port
Ports opposite to Designated Ports are always Root Port or Blocking Port(if cost is low it will be root port)
If cost are same then again we compare with bridge id
console cable is also callled roll over cable
USB to serial cable can be used to connect router to laptop
Never ever set multiple default roue otherwise packet willl loop see this

In this example ISP must know 7.1.1.0 network and 192.168.0.0 network along with other public internet networks whereas router0 can only know 192.168.0.0 and 7.0.0.0 network and then it should have default route pointed to 7.1.1.2 hop so that if inside network gives packet to unknown destination router0 forwards it to isp router
vlan 1,1002-1005 are by default (vlan 1 is already there by default)
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next_hop> is default route on router (router will send on this route only if no entries are present for destination network)
127.0.0.1 is loopback address
